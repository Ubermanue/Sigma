## File cloning open source by Sintacs Ao.

It's using a rich module to make a GUI eye-catching. Already added the [PyBookScrapper](https://github.com/sintxcs/PyBookScrapper) and [PyBookAgents](https://github.com/sintxcs/PyBookAgents) modules.

## Features:
```
• Can print name of the account
• Can print followers count
• Can print friends count
• Can print year created
```
> **Notice!**: It's free to modify but don't sell it as yours because you get the script free.
